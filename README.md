# remaining-download-time
## ⚠️ WIP : Does not work as of right now.

### **Quick project to learn C++ and make myself a QoL app for when I download things.**

> This project was made in order to paliate to the lack of native features from Windows to get your bitrate simply and quickly with one click.

### > Why ?
I created this small project to first learn C++ and to create an app that would let me calculate the time i'll spend downloading a file (because my internet sucks).  

I also had in mind that being able to know your average bitrate by knowing how much time you spent downloading a file can be useful in some cases.

### > How to use ?
For now you don't as it does not work. I plan to make it so that a custom GUI will open for a more user-friendly usage.  

### > Help ?
No. I'm working on this already and I don't take commissions. I'm not some engineer or professional and I don't distribute my program for that.

### > Who ?
Me.
